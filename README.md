take example of a travelling agency with employee, department and project attribute with employee having e_id,e_name,gender and dob, department having d_no and d_name, project having p_id,p_name and location
this is the ER diagram for my rdbms lab file

i am telling you all the labs-
lab 1	•	Introduction to basic DDL, DML and DCL commands and domain types in SQL.
•	DDL statements to create, drop, alter, view and rename the Database.	

lab 2 •	Write DML statements to insert the values into the tables. Use variants to insert values such as insert multiple records and insert records resulting from a select query.
•	Write statements to add and delete a column in a table which is pre-existent.
•	Write DML statements to update a table for single and multiple field updation.
•	Write DML statements to delete single or multiple record(s) from a table.

lab 3-4 •	Add primary key constraint to a pre-existent table.
•	Add NOT NULL / UNIQUE constraint to a pre-existent column.
•	Define the foreign key constraint. Show the errors returned by Database when:
•	 a) FK constraint is violated 
•	b) A referenced item is deleted
•	Define and demonstrate cascading effect in foreign key referenced tables.
•	Define, add and drop the check/default constraint.
•	Define auto increment arguments/attributes of a table.

lab 5-6 •	Practice SELECT query with following options:
Distinct, order by, between, top/max/min and other aggregation keywords, group by, having, wild card matching, exists
•	Nested subqueries

lab 7-8 •	Write a query to create INNER JOIN / LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN / FULL JOIN in two tables.

lab 9 •	Write a query to create/delete VIEW from two tables including some selection criteria.
•	Write a query to create and delete clustered/non-clustered index for a table.

lab 10-11 •	To implement the concept of trigger in database:
	How to apply database triggers
	Types of database triggers
	Create/delete database triggers
	Create trigger to demonstrate magic tables (INSERTED and DELETED).
	Create a hypothetical situation to undo the changes in a table via Trigger (Max credit limit reached/ Balance insufficient etc.).
